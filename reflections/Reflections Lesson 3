When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on a Cloud host or a network somewhere. This makes it easier for software
engineers to easily working together on a project because they can push and pull commits of the working repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: You might be working on a branch which is entirely diffferent than the master branch or any other branch on your remote repository. Therefore,
you always want to pull manuel in order to not make changes to the branch you are currently working on you do not wish to have.
